# Project Theseus

Project Theseus is a sub project of Project Anemoi. Project Theseus aims to tackle the problem of streaming video over packet switched networks, then applying that capability in order to control a vehicle in real time.

In order to simplify the problem by a few magnitudes, Theseus controls an RC car, not a quadcopter, which is the end goal of its parent project.
